# THE NIGHTWISH PLATFORM #

An online interactive fanzine for dedicated fans of the great symphonic metal band

## Purpose
The aim for this project is to create a PLATFORM for NIGHTWISH fans to gather and share thoughts and opinions as well as exchange experiences with each other about NIGHTWISH.

### Goal
As an owner, my goal is to be able to run and maintain a PLATFORM that will use the CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in order to serve dedicated fans of NIGHTWISH. The user will have the choice of either sign up as a Member to the PLATFORM or to just remain a Guest
This means that the user will be able to: 

## Features

If the user choose to sign up to the PLATFORM they will become a Member.
The Members of the PLATFORM will enjoy the following features(new features not presented above are written in bold italics):

## Project Journey

While staring up my blog project, I wanted to have a clear overview of what features and functions I need my PLATFORM in order to have a fully functional PLATFORM.	
After discussing with my fellow classmates at Code Institute it came to my understanding that it is a very good idea to start with a sketch or flowchart. So I started to create the Use Case Diagram as visible below:

## Agile
In software and web development, it is very useful to adapt the Agile mindset when working on or starting up a project. 
For this project, I have imagined and made up an imaginary group of people and they are called Users. 
I sort these Users in three different categories: Guests, Members and Admin.
One important agile tool to use in the very beginning of a project is called User Stories.
So the User Strories for my project are as stated below.

### Design thinking and User Stories
I order to approach this project in a Design Thinkng way, I have put myself in the User's perspective so that I can manage to sort out what the purpose of the PLATFORM will be.

For the User Story part, I have referred to the very reliable source of Niel McEwens Common Agile Practices content from Code Institute.

#### Guest

- As a Guest, I want to be able to read posts without signing up for the PLATFORM in order to save time and energy.
- As a Guest, I want to be able to search for posts in order to find content that interests me.
- As a Guest, I want to be able to sign up to the PLATFORM in order to enjoy all features of a Member.

#### Member

- As a Member, I want to be able to Create posts so that I can share my thoughts and feelings to the world.
- As a Member, I want to be able to Read posts in order to be able to gain information about other peoples thoughts and feelings.
- As a Member, I want to be able to Update posts so that I can add any additional content of my choice.
- As a Member, I want to be able to Delete posts so that I can choose to not show a post that I do not like.
- As a Member, I want to be able to like posts in order to express my feelings about other peoples posts.

#### Admin
- As an Admin, I want to be able to verify the posts before they are visible at the PLATFORM, in order to avoid for example foul or abusive language or even harassment.
