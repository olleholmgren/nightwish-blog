# THE NIGHTWISH PLATFORM #

An online interactive fanzine for dedicated fans of the great symphonic metal band

## Purpose
The aim for this project is to create a PLATFORM for NIGHTWISH fans to gather and share thoughts and opinions as well as exchange experiences with each other about NIGHTWISH.

### Goal
As an owner, my goal is to be able to run and maintain a PLATFORM that will use the CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in order to serve dedicated fans of NIGHTWISH. The user will have the choice of either sign up as a Member to the PLATFORM or to just remain a Guest
This means that the user will be able to:

## Agile
In software and web development, it is very useful to adapt the Agile mindset when working on or starting up a project. 
For this project, I have imagined and made up an imaginary group of people and they are called Users. 
I sort these Users in three different categories: Guests, Members and Admin.
One important agile tool to use in the very beginning of a project is calles User Stories.
So the User Strories for my project are as stated below.

### User Stories

#### Guest
As a Guest, I want to be able to read posts without signing up for the PLATFORM in order to save time and energy

#### Member
As a Member, I want to be able to sign up to the PLATFORM in order to be able to create posts.

#### Admin
As an Admin, I want to be able to verify the posts before they are visible at the PLATFORM, in order to avoid for example foul or abusive language or even harassment.
